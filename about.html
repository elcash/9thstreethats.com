            <h3>9th Street Hats - It's over your head!</h3>
            <p>
            9th Street Hats was started as a brand of high quality wool hats at affordable prices.  Our line covers the basics and beyond, and pays extra attention to fit and finish.  The brand was started as a value line by Levine Hat company, the 100 year old Saint Louis hat experts.

            <h3>Why "9th Street?"</h3>
            <p>With over 100 years of history in Saint Louis, Levine's wanted to start a new brand from the very beginning.  We design the styles, source the materials and we pay extra
            attention to the finishing of the hats so their look, fit and finish is every bit as good as some of the more expensive hats we sell.  You will not find a better value than our basic wools and braid straw hats.</p>

            <h3>Where does the name "9th Street Hats" come from?</h3>
            <p>Levine Hats has always been in St Louis, and always on Washington Avenue.  Our original location, over 100 years ago was at 923 Washington Ave.  During that time (early 1900s) we were a small factory on the 4th floor of a large building, where you had to take an elevator to get to our showroom. We've come a long way since then; 9th Street Hats is our way of remembering our roots.</p>
